basically i went through all the gen 2/4 beytah sprites and picked out all the funny/unique looking ones for future reference
there's a good chance not all of them will be used but it'll be helpful to have them all in one place
also, if a design was used in a previous iteration (or if i've already included it in the hack), i skipped over it in future ones, so thats why some might be missing if you browse them out of order
if you feel like i've missed something feel free to add it and/or ping me on discord calling me a fucking idiot
